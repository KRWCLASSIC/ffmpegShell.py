ffs = FFmpeg Shell
fss = Ffmpeg Shell Script

No documentation for you

For anyone asking why PATH is an experiment thats because it's just too fragile, it could break when path to script changes, so yeah.
I'm planning to add new experiment for .fss double click running so i'll fix it using registry, it will update current path on launch
